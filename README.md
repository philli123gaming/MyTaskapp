 simple task app 

Project Title: To-Do List Application

Description:
Create a command-line to-do list application using Python. This application will allow users to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, view their to-do list, and remove tasks from the list.
I got the project idea from gpt I want to try doing more projects

will be doing updates by my own choice
check the readme as I update that too throughout the project
Features (done in order):

Add Task: Users can add tasks to their to-do list. - done
View Tasks: Users can view all tasks currently on their to-do list. - done
Mark Task as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed. - done
Remove Task: Users can remove tasks from their to-do list. - done
wipes all completed tasks - done
Task Priority: Allow users to assign priorities to tasks (e.g., high, medium, low) and implement functionality to sort tasks based on priority. - done
User Input Validation: Implement input validation to ensure that users provide valid inputs when adding, marking, or removing tasks. - sorta done
Task Description Editing: Enable users to edit task details after they've been added to the list. - done
make so that the mark task as complete module also does the reverse completed - done
Undo/Redo Functionality: Implement undo and redo functionality to allow users to revert their actions. - too way tooo long  for the delete tasks but - done
Task Categories: Allow users to categorize tasks (e.g., work, personal, shopping) - done
and implement features to filter tasks based on categories. - should be easy - done
Save/Load Tasks: Add functionality to save tasks to a file when the program exits and load them back when the program starts again. This can be achieved using file I/O operations. - done
(did use my background loader code for this)
consider making options so that the code can ask if u want to use tkinker of not


After spending a lot of time learning tkinter for use in my project I think I can finally start working on integrating a tkinker gui into my app im not really sure how to go about this and so ive gone about creating a branch where I will be doing all my work in - achieved basic gui and its functional

to improve I want to add: 

next plans
more windows options so I don't have to type into console anymore
GUI Interface: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt to provide a more user-friendly experience. - (probably using a markup language could be time to learn react or master sass)
add extra properties to files to  make updateable
add comments and make code more understandable - next

AUTOSAVE
need to increase the load that gets saved as a file such as todolist name and the task app version number
I plan on learning tktinker next probably C to make my work an application and sass 
will also work on a little blog or posts or letter talking about this project as its been awesome despite the nature of the project

misc features
need to control where files get saved maybe even a initial directory saved into the program
add more context options such as view tasks branching out into all and with fileter or delte tasks branching into delete singular and all completed or even the option to complete multiple tasks at once
maybe a recent tasks option

too far away

Due Dates: Introduce due dates for tasks and implement features to remind users of upcoming deadlines.

<h2>could be linked</h2>
User Accounts: Implement user authentication and allow multiple users to maintain separate to-do lists.


I fully want to clarify that I used gpt to get this idea with it acting an assistant to me in this project 

problems:
