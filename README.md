View Tasks: Users can view all tasks currently on their to-do list. - done
Mark Task as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed. - done
Remove Task: Users can remove tasks from their to-do list. - done
Implementation:
You can implement this project using Python's basic data structures like lists or dictionaries.

I got the project idea from gpt I want to try doing more projects

to improve I want to add a function that 
wipes all completed tasks
undo option
User Input Validation: Implement input validation to ensure that users provide valid inputs when adding, marking, or removing tasks.

Save/Load Tasks: Add functionality to save tasks to a file when the program exits and load them back when the program starts again. This can be achieved using file I/O operations.

Task Priority: Allow users to assign priorities to tasks (e.g., high, medium, low) and implement functionality to sort tasks based on priority.

Due Dates: Introduce due dates for tasks and implement features to remind users of upcoming deadlines.

User Accounts: Implement user authentication and allow multiple users to maintain separate to-do lists.

GUI Interface: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt to provide a more user-friendly experience.

Undo/Redo Functionality: Implement undo and redo functionality to allow users to revert their actions.

Task Categories: Allow users to categorize tasks (e.g., work, personal, shopping) and implement features to filter tasks based on categories.

Task Description Editing: Enable users to edit task descriptions after they've been added to the list.

Data Visualization: Provide visualizations of task completion statistics over time (e.g., using graphs or charts).

I fully want to clarify that I used gpt to get this idea with it acting an assistant to me in this project
